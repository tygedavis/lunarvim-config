# Welcome to my LunarVim Configuration

Just a quick note:
If you're interested in more about LunarVim you can check it out [here](https://www.lunarvim.org/#opinionated).

## Installation

Clone this repository in the `~/.config/` repository using this command:

`git clone git@github.com:tygedavis/lunarvim-config.git lvim`

This will clone this repository into the `.config` directory under a new directory called `lvim`.

Note:
In order to actually run LunarVim you will still need the `lvim.sh` file that comes when you install LunarVim for the first time.
An example of this file will soon be posted here.

Once cloned, run the `lvim` command to open LunarVim. In order to make the config work, run `:PackerSync`, `:PackerCompile`, and `:PackerInstall`.

Then, restart LunarVim and all of your plugins should be installed.
